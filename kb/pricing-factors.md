# Deck Pricing Factors

## What affects the cost of a deck?

2. **Material**:

   - Cedar: $$
   - Composite (Basic): $$
   - Composite (Premium): $$$
   - Ipe/Hardwood: $$$$
3. **Height/Elevation**: Decks higher off the ground need larger posts, more bracing, and stairs, increasing cost.
4. **Railings**: Aluminum or cable railings cost more than standard wood pickets.
