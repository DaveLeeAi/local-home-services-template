# Wood vs. Composite Decking

## Pressure-Treated Natural Wood (Pine)
**Pros:**
- Lower initial cost (30-50% cheaper upfront).
- Natural, authentic wood look and feel.
- Can be stained any color.

**Cons:**
- Requires annual maintenance (cleaning, staining, sealing).
- Prone to warping, splintering, and rot over time.
- Shorter lifespan (10-15 years typicall).

## Composite Decking (Trex, TimberTech)
**Pros:**
- Virtually zero maintenance (just soap and water cleaning).
- Resistant to rot, mold, scratching, and fading.
- Long warranties (25-50 years).
- Eco-friendly (made from recycled materials).

**Cons:**
- Higher initial investment.
- Can get hotter in direct sun (though newer technology mitigates this).

## Recommendation for Georgia
For long-term value and dealing with Georgia's humidity, we highly recommend **Composite Decking**.
