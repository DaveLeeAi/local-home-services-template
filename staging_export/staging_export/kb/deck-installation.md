# Custom Deck Installation

## Our Build Process
We specialize in custom decks tailored to your home's architecture and your lifestyle.

1. **Consultation**: We measure your space and discuss materials (wood vs composite).
2. **Design**: We create a 3D rendering of your new deck.
3. **Permitting**: We handle all Atlanta and metro area building permits.
4. **Construction**: Installation typically takes 1-2 weeks depending on size.

## Materials
- **Pressure-Treated Pine**: Economical, natural look, requires staining/sealing.
- **Composite (Trex/TimberTech)**: Low maintenance, fade resistant, 25-50 year warranty.
- **Hardwoods (Ipe)**: Ultra-premium, incredibly durable, distinct aesthetic.

## Timeline
Most projects are completed within 2-3 weeks from start of construction, though permitting can add time.
