# Warranties & Maintenance

## Our Workmanship Warranty
We stand behind our work with a **5-Year Craftsmanship Warranty**. This covers any defects related to the installation structure, framing, and stability.

## Material Warranties
- **Composite Decking**: Manufacturers like Trex and TimberTech offer 25-Year to 50-Year Fade & Stain Warranties.
- **Pressure-Treated Wood**: The lumber itself typically has a limited warranty against fungal decay, but not against warping or splitting (which is natural).

## Maintenance Tips
### Wood Decks
- **Clean**: Sweep regularly and wash with deck cleaner annually.
- **Seal/Stain**: Re-stain and seal every 2-3 years to protect against moisture and UV rays.
- **Inspect**: Check for loose nails or boards annually.

### Composite Decks
- **Clean**: Wash with soap and water or a gentle deck cleaner twice a year (Spring/Fall).
- **Avoid**: Do not use metal shovels or sharp edges that could scratch the surface.
